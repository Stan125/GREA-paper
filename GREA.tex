\section{Motivation}

R is a statistical software with an almost uncountable number of functions for different statistical methods, procedures and graphs. On the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) alone, the most popular network for adding new features to R via so called ``packages'', more than 8000 packages are ready to be downloaded\footnote{There were exactly 8895 packages on CRAN at August 4, 2016.}. Each of them provide a variety of functions to solve different tasks. For example, a package called ``Vector Generalized Linear and Additive Models" (or short VGAM) can be easily installed via the R command \li{install.packages("VGAM")} and, once loaded in R, provides functions to estimate a variety of different regression models.

These aforementioned packages with the underlying functions make R the popular statistical package it is today. But most of these additional features require some data to be of any use, most prominently regression model estimation functions. There exist datasets shipped with R, but for most academical purposes, external data will be required to generate new insights.

To read data into R, there are multiple ways, depending on the data type (e.g. .csv, .xlsx) and also the data size (big data, small data). Reading a .csv file, for example, can be achieved via the built-in R function \li{base::read.table("filename.csv")}. Big .csv files can be read very quick with the function \li{data.table::fread("bigfile.csv")} from the data.table package. Other packages provide even more functionality, e.g. for dealing with strings or a smaller number of required arguments inside of a function. Most of those packages are also available on CRAN. 

The availability of packages to read different filetypes in numerous ways is very helpful for the advanced R user, because there is almost no filetype that cannot be read via an R function. But it also poses a problem: If there are so many ways that a user can read a file into R, how will she/he remember all the necessary packages and functions, and their function arguments? This problem is often encountered by new R users, who want to use R's extended functionalities but fail at importing data into their working environment.

An answer to this problem is provided by Thomas Leeper's R package called ``rio", which tries to minimize redundancy by wrapping R reading functions into one import \li{rio::import()} and one export function \li{rio::export()}. 

The R package introduced with this paper takes it one step further. Built on the Shiny Framework and implemented as an RStudio Add-In, ``Gotta Read 'Em All" provides a GUI for reading all different file-formats into R. 

The general process is the following: In the beginning, the user selects a file on her/his computer. After some adjustments (which are done interactively), the proper function to read the file is pasted into the console, with an object name that can be specified by the user. In between, the user can always head to the preview to see what the parsed file would look like with the current options.

Using this Add-In, the user can now read data into R without remembering any code, but still obtains the correct R code to re-parse the data at a later point. 

\section{Underlying Frameworks}

\subsection{The Shiny Framework}

The Shiny Framework\footnote{\url{http://shiny.rstudio.com}} is in itself an R package designed to create interactive visualisations with R functions and HTML code. The author describes the package as ``combining the computational power of R with the interactivity of the modern web" (citing a web page blabla).The goal is to create applications with clickable interfaces quickly showcasing different scenarios. This is done via reactive R functions, which are run everytime a user interacts with the GUI. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.5, trim = 50 50 50 100]{figures/example_shiny_app.png}
\caption{Screenshot of an example Shiny Application.}
\label{exampleapp}
\end{centering}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{exampleapp} shows an example Shiny Application, consisting of some user interface (UI) control elements (a select button, and tick boxes) and a graph. The UI is reactive; whenever the user ticks a box or selects a different value in the first box, the graph changes its look. This is built upon reactive functions, which run every time a value inside them changes. The values that are allowed to change are therefore bound to the UI elements.

Shiny Apps consist of two elements: The UI and a ``server" side. The UI includes functions which wrap HTML to build the viewable part of the App, for example buttons and placement of graphs. The server side consists of functions that specify the reactive R functions which create dynamic output displayed on the UI side, and when the functions should be run. Both sides then are able to automatically communicate with each other to create a smooth interactive experience for the user. The code for an example Shiny app is attached below:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Example code for a Shiny Application\cite{w2}., label = code:exampleapp]
# Define UI
ui <- bootstrapPage(
  numericInput("n", "Number of obs", 100),
  plotOutput("plot")
)
# Define Server
server <-  function(input, output) {
  output$plot <- renderPlot({ hist(runif(input$n)) })
}
app <- shinyApp(ui, server)
# Run App
runApp(app)
\end{lstlisting}

It is now possible to see in Code-Chunk \ref{code:exampleapp} that both the UI and server elements are R objects, while the server also resembles an R function. \li{runApp()} then opens up the Application.

\subsection{Shiny Gadgets and RStudio Add-Ins}

Shiny Applications are useful for displaying interactive visualisations, but they are made for displaying results to the end user. ``Shiny Gadgets"\footnote{\url{http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/gadgets.html}}, an extension of the Shiny framework, are supposed to be part of the programming or analysing process. They are built on the same framework that was introduced with Shiny, but serve the purpose of making programming challenges a little easier. For example, a Shiny Gadget could be used to provide a UI for downloading certain data from complex websites. 

``RStudio Add-Ins"\footnote{https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/} are Shiny Gadgets that are built right into RStudio, an Integrated Developer Environment (IDE) for R. Calling the Shiny Gadget is made easier, as the RStudio user only has to press two buttons. Furthermore, Add-Ins have extended access to RStudio itself via a package called ``rstudioapi". For example, Add-Ins are able to paste a string into the console and can modify the currently opened R script.

The combination of the Shiny framework and RStudio add-ins creates the ideal setting for an Add-In that helps the user parse any data format into R. The Shiny Framework provides interactiveness and the RStudio connection makes it easier to call the Application out of an IDE.

\section{Implementation}

An R-Studio Add-In has to be installed via the R package ecosystem, so GREA is also wrapped up in a package called GREA. Calling the Add-In is done via the main function \li{GREA::GREA()}. Also, there exist a couple of helper functions, which were necessary to reduce redundant R code.
The following functions are implemented:

\begin{itemize}
\item \li{GREA()}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Main Function: \textrm{GREA()}}
\subsection{The File Reading Function: \textrm{GREA\_read()}}
